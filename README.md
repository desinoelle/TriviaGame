Brief Overview: This project is a Stranger Things themed trivia game. The game starts as soon as the browser opens and the timer starts counting down. The user has ten seconds to answer each question. If the question is answered incorrectly or if the question not answered within the time frame, the user does not get any points and the game automatically moves on to the next question. If the answer is correct, the user's score increases by a point and the game moves on to the next question. At the end of the game, the score is displayed for the user and a restart button appears, which allows the user to restart the game completely. This game has a few bugs that i'm still trying to work out.
